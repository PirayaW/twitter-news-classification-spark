|b'@zkim229 No worries at all.'|
|b'@zkim229 "ratios"'|
|b'@zkim229 Dividend payout rations in general are not that high.'|
|b'@conorsen @lhamtil Swing rate in all counts is up in recent years. Strike zone is bigger, hitters go up there cutting. Not all velocity.'|
|b'@zkim229 What comapnies with no earnings are doing that? Some oil companies maybe.'|
|b'@zkim229 In what sense? Stocks are perpetual and dividends should rise over time, so not perfectly analogous.'|
|b"@conorsen I know you're sticking to that as the main explanation, but it doesn't alter the analogy."|
|b'Maybe a similar result? Quants killed the bunt but league-wide scoring drought. Kill election cycle, still no alpha? https://t.co/NkqbnpYM8k'|

|b'@sharkbiotech @ukarlewitz Sorry to barge in here, but how was "persistently low VIX" defined in this study? Thx.'|
|b"@aarontask Still, I wouldn't have thought a Time Inc. employee would be allowed to invoke the idea of a cover jinx..."|

|b'@jonnajarian @cnbcclosingbell @kelly_evans Don\'t you mean "Live with Kelly &amp; Michael"? Come Monday, that name becomes officially available.'|
|b'@PSpoljarick Just catch-up.'|
|b'@ZoomZoomDoom The market is no more volatile day to day than it was before computers. Average daily move is like 0.8% dating back to 1896.'|
|b'@ZoomZoomDoom It\'s pet peeve of mine, folks scapegoating "machines." Like a floor trader in 1920 whining about "those damn phone orders."'|
|b'@ZoomZoomDoom Not "machines." It\'s asset values looking more or less attractive on a relative basis due to fresh data.'|
|b"@ZoomZoomDoom No, it's just a result of some mechanical/quant relationships falling into line."|
|b'RT @AheadoftheNews: nowhere else to go trade every time TNX gets around 1.7% holding up equities, but bonds so far could not care less and?'|

|b"@TheLimerickKing Read the Preet Bharara profile in @NewYorker. As he says, not every fire is arson. And he'd have loved to lock bankers up."|

|b'@SBarlow_ROB And then tweeting out the rejected ideas, I get it.'|
|b'@SBarlow_ROB Why are you encouraging that sort of thing?'|
|b'@beatlesonbankin @JeffMacke Not all about the macro/Fed. This is the life cycle of industries and companies.'|
|b'@JeffMacke Gap should\'ve been LBO\'d by now. That\'s how you "shrink strategically," invest online. In this case, beats constant buybacks.'|
|b"Shopping, but only for dividends. Here's huge mall owner $SPG vs. shares of three big mall chains. Can this persist? https://t.co/wCTTwRpPip"|
|b'@JeffMacke Could Gap have spent $1B/year constructively? This is the issue. Mature companies have cash flow but few high-return prospects.'|
|b"@r_buyer It's in the company's reported results. Roughly $700k/employee, last year $344k, lower in Q1."|
|b'@Honest_T @TrinityAssetMan I know. Still not the major swing factor in $GS results.'|
|b"@Honest_T @TrinityAssetMan Engineering goes until a crisis stops it. But advisory is not the main driver of $GS's business."|
|b'@r_buyer The stocks are reflecting the tight constraints on the business of banking. Compensation/employee down by half. Not separable.'|
|b"@TrinityAssetMan Not just one CNBC guest, that was the intent. Problem is, for many they're utilities not permitted to pay good dividends."|
|b"@BobLoukas You're wrong there. Compensation per employee has been cut in half since the crisis."|

|b'@hmeisler @georgepearkes @optstrategist Yes, though "stocks only" advance-decline didn\'t just get back to an old high as the broad one did.'|
|b'@hmeisler @georgepearkes It was less of an issue in the old days when stocks and bonds tended to move together rather than in opposition.'|

|b'@modestproposal1 Right, but the stock was egregiously valued then even on the fake numbers.'|
