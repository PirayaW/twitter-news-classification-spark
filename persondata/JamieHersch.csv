|b'Devastating news.. Steven Stamkos out 1-3 months with a blood clot in his right arm, per Steve Yzerman.'|
|b'Wow. Sabres kill off a 2-minute 5-on-3 for the Rangers to keep a 4-3 lead late in the third.'|
|b'Congrats to Predators on clinching a playoff spot. Crazy to think 7 teams have clinched in the West, and just 1 in the East! #parity'|
|b"Detroit's win means no clinching yet for the Rangers, and no clinching for Penguins unless St. Louis rallies, down 5-2 to Boston."|
|b'HUGE win for Red Wings to pull even with Philly yet again in points. Could come down to Game 82 to see who makes it between BOS, PHI &amp; DET.'|
|b'@Twins_morsecode Thanks for the laugh. Miss you and @LaVelleNeal !! ?'|
|b'Ducks are back on top of the Pacific, one point ahead of the Kings and both teams have 6 games remaining.'|

|b'Huge swing in favor of the Wild tonight, with a big win to sweep the season series vs. Chicago PLUS Avalanche trail 3-1 in the 3rd.'|
|b"@showfortime Why can't they get top seed in the West?"|
|b'@crvitton haha awesome. Go... Wolverines?'|
